The methodology is a Weighted Heuristic Model designed to calculate a Wear-Out Risk Index (0–100) for a creative. The model is not a statistical regression but uses normalization and summation of weighted scores assigned to various factors to estimate cumulative media and creative pressure.

The methodology is divided into three key risk blocks that determine the final score contribution:

Performance Effectiveness Drivers (Up to 70 points): These are the most critical factors, reflecting actual consumer response. They include Average Frequency (OTS), which is the primary driver of saturation (25 points), and Declining BHT Metric Dynamics (Ad Recall in Meta, Consideration in YouTube). A drop in these metrics combined with high frequency sharply increases the risk, while growth (Wear-In) reduces it.

Contextual & Strategic Drivers (Up to 60 points): These evaluate the structural intensity of the media plan. This includes Cross-Platform Saturation (summing the risk across selected channels, where TV and META carry the highest weight), Competitive Share of Spend (SoS), and Accumulated Risk (number of campaigns and burst length).

Creative Format Drivers (Up to 10 points): These assess the creative format, as long-form videos (30 seconds) wear out faster than short bumpers (5 seconds) or static formats.

The final score classifies the creative state: 0–39 (Optimal), 40–69 (Moderate Risk), 70–100 (High Risk).
